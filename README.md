# **Eco-Grant DAO — Sustainable Tourism DAO for Protected Areas**

### ✨ Empowering communities to fund and manage sustainable tourism initiatives in protected areas

---

## **1. Executive Summary**

**Eco-Grant DAO** is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that enables
international donors to fund sustainable tourism initiatives in protected areas
while ensuring local communities benefit from conservation efforts. Built on the
**BlockDAG Primordial Testnet**, we combine community-driven governance with
efficient funding mechanisms:

- 🌍 **Community Governance**: Local stakeholders vote on project funding and
  implementation
- 🔐 **Transparent Funding**: Public ledger for all donations and project
  expenditures
- 📊 **Sustainable Impact**: Focus on conservation and community development
- 💰 **Local Access**: Easy conversion between crypto and local currency

### Why Blockchain is Essential

While traditional funding mechanisms exist, blockchain is **crucial** for
Eco-Grant DAO because:

1. **Provable Community Control:**
   - Traditional models rely on trust in administrators
   - Blockchain enables verifiable, on-chain voting
   - Stakeholders can independently verify their influence
   - No centralized authority can override community decisions

2. **Unprecedented Donor Transparency:**
   - Traditional models: Annual reports, trust-based
   - Blockchain: Real-time, independently verifiable fund tracking
   - Every donation and disbursement is publicly recorded
   - Donors can audit fund usage without intermediaries

3. **Automated, Trust-Minimized Execution:**
   - Traditional: Manual fund release, human delays
   - Blockchain: Smart contracts execute based on verified votes
   - No single party controls fund release
   - Faster, more efficient fund distribution

4. **Global Access to Capital:**
   - Traditional: Limited by banking infrastructure
   - Blockchain: Anyone with crypto can participate
   - Lower barriers to international funding
   - Reduced transaction costs

### Core Value Proposition

Eco-Grant DAO provides a **community-driven funding mechanism** that:

1. **Empowers Local Stakeholders**: Park rangers, community members, and tourism
   operators collectively decide on projects
2. **Enables Global Support**: International donors can easily contribute to
   conservation efforts
3. **Ensures Sustainable Development**: Projects must balance tourism,
   conservation, and community needs

## **2. Problem Statement**

Protected areas face critical challenges:

1. **Funding Gaps:**
   - Limited government resources
   - Unreliable donor funding
   - High operational costs
   - Infrastructure needs
