# **TurismoDAO ‚Äî Milestone-Governed Tourism Crowdfunding for Local Communities**

### ‚ú® Reimagining tourism funding in Panam√°, powered by EVM and BlockDAG.

---

## **1. Executive Summary**

**TurismoDAO** is a decentralized crowdfunding platform enabling Panamanian
communities to fund and manage tourism improvement projects through a hybrid DAO
structure. Built to deploy on the **BlockDAG Primordial Testnet**, the MVP
emphasizes **milestone-based funding**, **community voting**, **reputation-based
governance**, and **a pragmatic on-/off-ramp solution** (still) without oracles.

Our project combines smart contract rigor with a clear, real-world use case. It
fulfills the criteria for innovation, testability, and real impact on local
economies.

## **2. Problem Statement**

Local communities in Panama have rich tourism potential but lack equitable
access to funding and decision-making power. Traditional funding channels are:

- Centralized and bureaucratic,
- Hard to access for grassroots proposals,
- Often misaligned with the needs of the community.

There is no transparent or community-controlled way to fund and monitor tourism
projects at the local level.

---

## **3. The TurismoDAO Solution**

TurismoDAO provides a trust-minimized way for communities to:

- **Propose tourism initiatives** (e.g., eco-trails, signage, cultural events),
- **Crowdfund with BDAG tokens**, backed by verifiable fiat contributions,
- **Unlock funding in phases**, upon community-verified milestone completion,
- Govern using a **reputation + stake-weighted voting model**,
- Penalize bad actors with **slashing** to maintain accountability.

This empowers citizens as stakeholders in their region‚Äôs tourism development.

## **4. Core Features**

### üßæ Project Proposals

- Any user can submit a basic proposal with:
  - Project title + description
  - Fundraising target
  - Number of planned milestones

### üéØ Milestone-Based Crowdfunding

- Funds are disbursed **only after milestones are verified** and approved by DAO
  vote.
- Proposers receive **only a portion of funds per milestone**, not upfront lump
  sums.

### üó≥ DAO Voting System

- Community votes on whether a milestone has been fulfilled using:
  - **Reputation Score**: Based on proposer track record and voter
    participation.
  - **Staked Test Tokens**: Voters must stake tokens to vote, encouraging skin
    in the game.
- Voting results are recorded on the BlockDAG for full transparency.

### üß® Slashing Conditions

- If a proposer receives funds but **fails to deliver a verified milestone**,
  they are:
  - **Slashed**: Lose their staked collateral.
  - **Reputation-penalized**: Future proposals carry less weight/trust.
- Optionally, voters who voted ‚Äúyes‚Äù on failed milestones also lose partial
  stake (to deter careless validation).

### üß¨ Reputation System

- Each proposer and voter builds a **public on-chain reputation score** based
  on:
  - Successful proposal completion,
  - Reliable voting behavior,
  - Engagement with the DAO.

### üåâ On-Chain On-/Off-Ramp

A minimalist, oracle-free fiat ‚Üî token system tailored for hackathon delivery:

#### On-Ramp: DAO-Whitelisted Contribution + Escrow

- A trusted custodian (e.g., NGO or tourism network partner) receives fiat from
  donors.
- Once verified off-chain, a DAO-authorized multisig triggers the minting of
  test tokens on BlockDAG, logging the amount, donor identity (if needed), and
  transaction hash.

#### Off-Ramp: Milestone-Triggered Release

- Upon DAO-approved milestone completion, an on-chain event signals token
  payout.
- The same multisig wallet authorizes the fiat release by the custodian to the
  project team.
- All steps are transparent, verifiable, and documented on-chain for
  auditability.

### üåç Frontend Interface

- Web app interface includes:
  - Project browser
  - Voting dashboard
  - Milestone submission + IPFS-based evidence viewer
  - Reputation + stake display
  - Fiat ‚Üî Token event explorer (MVP)
